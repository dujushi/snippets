# A React JS practice: Travel Plan
It was implemented by following along with the Tutorial on React JS official website.
Travel Plan uses two Google Maps Javascript APIs: AutocompleteService and DistanceMatrixService.
AutocompleteService provides address predictions as users are typing their travel stops.
DistanceMatrixService would calculte the travel distance and duration from last stop.
